Know yourself and accept that.\
The Johari Window for beter communication, stronger relationships.\
**Open Area (Arena) -** Known to Self and Known to Others.\
**Blind Area (Blind Spot) -** Unknown to Self but Known to Others.\
**Hidden Area (Fa√ßade) -** Known to Self but Unknown to Others.\
**Unknown Area (Unknown) -** Unknown to Self and Unknown to Others.

## How the Johari Window Works:

- **Expanding the Open Area:** By sharing more about yourself with others (disclosing), and by seeking feedback, you can expand the "Open Area" and reduce the "Hidden" and "Blind" areas.
- **Reducing the Blind Spot:** Feedback from others can help you become aware of your "Blind Spot," allowing you to see yourself more accurately.
- **Exploring the Unknown:** Through self-discovery, reflection, or therapy, you can uncover aspects of yourself that were previously unknown to both you and others.

## Application of the Johari Window:

- **In Personal Relationships:** Helps improve communication and trust by encouraging openness and feedback.
- **In Teams and Organizations:** Enhances teamwork by fostering a culture of openness, feedback, and mutual understanding.
- **In Therapy:** Assists in self-discovery and personal growth by exploring the different areas of the self.

<b>**Theories on Learning**</b>

- Behaviouristic theories
    + Classical conditioning
    + Operant conditioning
- Cognitive Theories
- Social learning theory


## Part-1

## Classical Conditioning (Ivan Pavlov - Dog Experiment)

| Col1 | Col2 | Col3 | Col4 |
|---------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Before Conditioning | Neutral Stimulus (Ring Bell) | No Food  |Dog (No Salivation)|
| During Conditioning | Neutral Stimulus (Ring Bell) | Unconditioned Stimulus (Give Food)| Unconditional Response (Dog Salivates)|
| After Conditioning | Conditioned Stimulus (Ring Bell) | No Food | Conditioned Response (Dog Salivates)|

**Example:** Child Tramua, Bad Experince

## Operant Conditioning

- Also known as Instrutmental Conditioning  

- **Law of effect (Thorndike):** behaviours which are followed by desirable consequences will be strengthened and those leading to undesirable consequences will be weakened.

It's a core concept in behavioral psychology, originally developed by B.F. Skinner.\
Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

1. **Reinforcement:** This involves increasing the likelihood of a behavior by following it with a pleasant outcome.

    - **Positive Reinforcement:** Adding a rewarding stimulus after the behavior, e.g., giving a dog a treat for sitting on command.
    - **Negative Reinforcement:** Removing an unpleasant stimulus after the behavior, e.g., turning off a loud noise when a rat presses a lever.

2. **Punishment:** This involves decreasing the likelihood of a behavior by following it with an unpleasant outcome.

    - **Positive Punishment:** Adding an unpleasant stimulus after the behavior, e.g., scolding a child for misbehaving.
    - **Negative Punishment:** Removing a rewarding stimulus after the behavior, e.g., taking away a toy when a child acts out.

4. **Extinction:** This occurs when a behavior that was previously reinforced is no longer reinforced, leading to a decrease in that behavior over time.

Operant conditioning is widely used in various settings, including education, therapy, animal training, and behavior modification programs.

**Which method is better in operant conditioning to shape someone's behaviour?**

**Using Punishment** is a very easy way to reinforce a one's behaviour. But it is not sustainable in a long run, many other times it leads to harmful effects.

- Most used,least understood and badly administered.
- Punishment is a complex phenomenon.
- Should be carefully defined and used.
- Punishment can increase negative behaviour by paying attention to them.
- Punishment can lead to anxiety, aggression, depression, hatred etc.
- It's a lose-lose approach.
- Based on threat and fear.
- Use red-hot-stove approach
    - Warn
    - Prompt
    - Consistent
    - Impersonal
    
<r>**Punishment should be least preferred method in shaping one's behaviour.**</r>


## Part-2

- Patterns of administering rewards.
- Continuous reinforcement: all desired behaviours are reinforced.
- Partial reinforcement:
    + Fixed interval schedules
    + Variable interval schedules
    + Fixed ratio schedules
    + Variable ratio schedules


3. **Schedules of Reinforcement:** These are the rules that dictate how often a behavior is reinforced.

    - **Fixed-Ratio Schedule:** Reinforcement is given after a set number of responses.
    - **Variable-Ratio Schedule:** Reinforcement is given after an unpredictable number of responses, leading to high response rates (e.g., gambling).
    - **Fixed-Interval Schedule:** Reinforcement is given after a set period, leading to increased behavior as the time for reinforcement approaches.
    - **Variable-Interval Schedule:** Reinforcement is given at unpredictable time intervals, resulting in steady response rates.
