## <b>SELF-CONSCIOUS VS SOCIAL EMOTIONS</b>

### <dg>Self-Conscious Emotions:-</dg>

> Self-conscious emotions are emotions that require self-reflection and self-awareness.\
These emotions are closely tied to our sense of self and often arise when we evaluate ourselves against our internal standards, goals, or societal norms.\
**Simply, it is a feeling that stem from within.**

**E.g. Shame, Guilt, Embarrassment, Pride and Humiliation.**

- **<smb>Shame</smb>**: A feeling of distress or embarrassment about something perceived as improper or dishonorable about oneself. Shame often involves the desire to hide or escape from the situation. **OR** Shame: arises due to feeling of inadequacy, and perception of harmful or disreputable behaviour or when our reputation is at stake.


- **<smb>Guilt</smb>**: A feeling of remorse or regret about something one has done or failed to do. Guilt is often linked to specific actions and can motivate a person to make amends.

- **<smb>Embarrassment</smb>**: A mild form of self-conscious emotion that occurs when one feels exposed or awkward, usually in front of others. Unlike shame, embarrassment is usually more fleeting and less intense.

- **<smb>Pride</smb>**: A positive self-conscious emotion that arises from a sense of accomplishment or recognition of one's abilities or achievements. Pride can have both positive and negative connotations (e.g., hubris or arrogance).

- **<smb>Humiliation</smb>**: A feeling of being degraded or belittled, often in a public context. Humiliation is more intense than embarrassment and is associated with a loss of dignity. **OR** Humiliation: feel of reduced to a lower position in our own or other’s eyes. Feeling of disgrace and attack on self-respect.


These emotions are essential for self-regulation and moral development. They help individuals learn from their experiences and adjust their behavior to align with social norms and personal values.


### <dg>Social Emotions:-</dg>

> Social emotions are emotions that arise from interactions with others and are closely linked to our social relationships.\
These emotions help navigate social dynamics and maintain group cohesion.\
**Simply, it is a feeling based on information external to themselves.**

**E.g. Pity, Envy, Jealousy, etc...**

- **<smb>Empathy</smb>**: The ability to understand and share the feelings of others. Empathy is crucial for forming emotional connections and fostering compassion and cooperation.

- **<smb>Jealousy</smb>**: A complex emotion that arises from a perceived threat to a valued relationship or position. Jealousy involves feelings of insecurity, fear, and concern over a potential loss.

- **<smb>Envy</smb>**: An emotion that occurs when one desires something that someone else has. Envy can lead to feelings of inferiority or resentment but can also motivate self-improvement.

- **<smb>Love</smb>**: A deep affection or attachment to someone or something. Love is a complex emotion that encompasses feelings of warmth, protection, and intimacy.

- **<smb>Gratitude</smb>**: A positive emotion that arises when one recognizes and appreciates a benefit received from another person. Gratitude encourages prosocial behavior and strengthens social bonds.

- **<smb>Sympathy</smb>**: A feeling of concern or sorrow for someone else's misfortune. Sympathy often leads to supportive and altruistic behavior.

- **<smb>Anger</smb>**: Although often considered a basic emotion, anger in a social context can be a response to perceived injustice, betrayal, or unfair treatment, motivating one to address or rectify the situation.

- **<smb>Resentment</smb>**: It arises from interactions with others and is typically based on feelings of unfairness, injustice, or being wronged in a social context. Resentment is often directed towards another person or group and is shaped by social dynamics, such as perceived inequality, favoritism, or mistreatment.

> Both self-conscious and social emotions are integral to human development and social functioning. They influence behavior, decision-making, and interpersonal relationships, playing a key role in how individuals navigate their social world. Understanding and managing these emotions can lead to healthier, more meaningful connections with others and a more balanced sense of self.


## <b>MOODS</b>

+ Mood is not targeted towards any in internal or external object.

+ Sometimes, we feel low. Sometimes, we feel high. - Mood
 
+ It is an unfocused, relatively mild feeling that exists as background to our daily experience.

+ It is not for a specific reason.

+ Positive emotions and job performance.

+ **Mood congruence:** tendency to recall positive things when in a good mood and vice versa.

> **Mood congruence** refers to the psychological phenomenon where an individual’s current mood influences the retrieval and perception of information.\
Specifically, it means that people are more likely to remember information that is consistent with their current mood.\
For example, when someone is feeling happy, they are more likely to recall happy memories and view things more positively.\
Conversely, when someone is feeling sad, they are more likely to remember sad or negative memories and perceive situations more negatively.

+ **Temperment:** Unlike personality, which can be shaped by life experiences and environment, temperament is largely influenced by genetic factors and is evident from early childhood. It generally remains relatively stable throughout life. Temperament influences how individuals respond to their environment and manage their emotions.

## <b>MANAGING EMOTIONS AT WORK PLACE</b>

<r>**Why should we manage emotions at work place?**</r>

- **<smb>Emotional Contagion</smb>**: It is the phenomenon where one person’s emotions and related behaviors directly trigger similar emotions and behaviors in others.

- **<smb>Work-Family Spillover Effect</smb>**: It refers to the transfer of emotions, behaviors, and stressors from one domain of life (work or family) to the other. This concept can operate in both directions: work can affect family life, and family life can affect work.

- **<smb>Emotional labor</smb>**: involves managing and sometimes suppressing one's emotions to fulfill the emotional requirements of a job. It is particularly relevant in service-oriented professions where employees must display certain emotions to satisfy organizational expectations and maintain customer satisfaction. The psychological effort involved in holding back one’s true emotions is called Emotional Labour.


    - **Surface Acting:** Faking emotions that are not genuinely felt, such as smiling at a customer even when one is frustrated or unhappy. Surface acting can lead to emotional exhaustion and burnout over time.
    - **Deep Acting:** Trying to genuinely feel the emotions one is required to display, such as empathizing with a customer’s concerns to truly feel compassionate. Deep acting is generally considered more sustainable and less emotionally draining than surface acting.
    - **Impact:** Emotional labor can affect job satisfaction, employee well-being, and performance. Jobs with high emotional labor demands can be mentally exhausting and may contribute to stress, burnout, and emotional dissonance.

- **<smb>Emotional dissonance</smb>**: occurs when there is a conflict between the emotions one truly feels and the emotions one is expected to display due to social or professional expectations. This discrepancy can cause psychological discomfort and stress. Simply, the inconsistencies between felt emotions and expressed emotions.


## <b>ANGER OR AGGRESSION</b>

Many of us find it difficult to control anger because anger is a very charged emotion or a very extreme kind of a emotion and the kind of you know effect it has on ourselves and others is severe or very intense.

### Aggression is Bad:-

<strong><g>HOLDING ON TO ANGER IS LIKE\
GRASPING A HOT COAL WITH THE\
INTENT OF THROWING IT AT\
SOMEONE ELSE; YOU ARE THE ONE\
WHO GETS BURNED - BUDDHA</g>

<g>SPEAK WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY - AND\
YOU'LL MAKE THE BEST SPEECH\
YOU'LL EVER REGRET - DR.LAURENCE J. PETER</g></strong>


### Aggression is Good:-

<strong><g>THE WORLD NEEDS ANGER. THE\
WORLD OFTEN CONTINUES TO\
ALLOW EVIL BECAUSE IT ISN'T\
ANGRY ENOUGH - BEDE JARRETT</g>

<g>A MAN IS ABOUT AS BIG AS THE\
THINGS THAT MAKE HIM ANGRY - CHURCHILL</g></strong>

+ Aggression can be passive.
    + It is not good. It never helps in resolving a problem.

### PATTERNS OF AGGRESSION

<strong><r>What causes aggression to happen? Most specifically in work place.</r></strong>
   
#### <dg>Threat-based aggression:</dg>

   - **Definition**: It is an aggressive response that occurs when an individual perceives a threat to their safety, territory, status, or resources. It is often a defensive reaction aimed at protecting oneself or one's group from harm or loss. This type of aggression is usually instinctual and can be triggered by fear or anxiety when a threat is perceived. **OR** self-defense and aggression that grows out of fear.
        + There can be a real stimulus(True reason) or perceived stimulus(Imagining there is a reason).
        + It can be resolved by talking or taking necessary actions.

- **Example:**  A person walking home late at night hears footsteps approaching rapidly from behind. Feeling threatened, they turn around and shout at the approaching person to back off, possibly raising their fists in a defensive stance. This aggression is driven by the perceived threat to their personal safety.

#### <dg>Irritable aggression:</dg>

   - **Definition**: It refers to aggressive behavior that arises from frustration, annoyance, or irritation. This type of aggression is typically impulsive and can occur in response to relatively minor provocations or frustrations. It is not necessarily triggered by a direct threat but rather by a lower tolerance for frustration or irritants. **OR** response to pain or disturbance or irritation.
        + We can use breathing type of techinques to control the irritation.

- **Example:**  A person has had a long and stressful day at work. When they get home, their partner accidentally spills a drink on the table. Already irritable, the person snaps and yells at their partner, overreacting to the minor mistake. This aggression is impulsive and driven by accumulated irritation and a low tolerance for frustration.

#### <dg>Frustration-based aggression:</dg>
   - **Definition**: It occurs when an individual is blocked from achieving a goal or experiencing an expected reward, leading to feelings of frustration. The frustration-aggression hypothesis suggests that frustration often leads to aggressive behavior as a means of overcoming obstacles or expressing dissatisfaction. **OR** when my goal oriented behaviour is blocked.

- **Example:**  A child is building a tower with blocks, but every time they get close to finishing, the tower falls over. After several attempts, the child becomes increasingly frustrated and eventually throws the remaining blocks across the room. This aggression is a direct result of the frustration caused by repeatedly being thwarted from achieving the goal of building the tower.

#### <dg>Instrumental aggression:</dg>
   - **Definition**: It is goal-oriented and calculated. This type of aggression is used as a tool to achieve a specific outcome, such as gaining power, control, or resources. Unlike the other forms of aggression that are reactive, instrumental aggression is proactive and planned. **OR** using aggression to get something.

- **Example:**  In a competitive sports match, a soccer player deliberately fouls an opponent to prevent them from scoring a goal. The player’s aggression is not driven by anger or frustration but is a calculated action to stop the opponent and gain an advantage for their team. Here, aggression is used as a strategic tool to achieve a specific goal.


<strong><g>"Ultimately, it's up to the individual to decide whether their aggression will be a force for positive change or a path to self-destruction."</g></strong>

### <b>ASSERTIVE</b>
